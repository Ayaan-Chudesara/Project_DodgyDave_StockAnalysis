Stock Analysis Report Generator
This project demonstrates a simplified application that fetches historical stock data and uses the Google Gemini AI model to generate a financial report with a buy/sell/hold recommendation.

Project Overview
The core functionality of this project involves two main steps:

Fetching Stock Data: It retrieves historical daily stock data for a specified ticker symbol using the Polygon.io API.

AI-Powered Analysis: The fetched stock data is then sent to the Google Gemini API, which processes the data and generates a concise financial report, including a recommendation (buy, sell, or hold) and a brief explanation.

This simplified version focuses on the backend logic and outputs directly to the console.

Features
Fetches daily aggregate stock data for a hardcoded ticker (e.g., TSLA).

Integrates with Polygon.io for real-time and historical stock data.

Utilizes the Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model for AI-driven financial analysis.

Generates a text-based financial report with a clear buy/sell/hold recommendation.

Includes basic error handling for API calls.


API Keys
This project uses two external APIs, each requiring an API key:

Polygon.io API Key:

You need to obtain an API key from Polygon.io. They offer a free tier for developers.

Once you have your key, replace "YOUR_POLYGON_API_KEY_HERE" in the apiKeyPolygon constant within index.js (or your main JavaScript file) with your actual Polygon.io API key.

const apiKeyPolygon = "YOUR_POLYGON_API_KEY_HERE"; // Replace with your actual key

Google Gemini API Key:

For this project, when running in a Google Canvas environment, the Gemini API key (apiKeyGemini) is automatically provided by the environment. You can leave it as an empty string:

const apiKeyGemini = ""; // This is automatically provided by the Canvas environment

If you were to run this code outside of a Canvas environment, you would typically obtain a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio and provide it explicitly.
